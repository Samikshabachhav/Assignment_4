Python Assignment 4

Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors
Opens and reads a text file named sample.txt.
Prints its content line by line.
Handles errors gracefully using exception handling if the file does not exist.

How it works:
If sample.txt exists, the content is displayed line by line.
If sample.txt does not exist, it prints:
Error: The file 'sample.txt' was not found.


Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File
Takes user input and writes it to output.txt.
Takes additional input and appends it to the same file.
Reads and displays the final content of output.txt.
